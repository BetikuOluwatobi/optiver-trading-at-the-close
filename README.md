# Optiver - Trading at the Close
In this competition, I developed a model capable of predicting the closing price movements for hundreds of Nasdaq-listed stocks. The data included information from the order book and the closing auction of the stocks.

## Solution Overview
My approach to solving this challenge focused on:
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful signals from the order book and auction data.
Model Development: Building a robust predictive model to capture the price movement dynamics.
Performance Optimization: Ensuring accurate and efficient predictions by fine-tuning the model parameters.
